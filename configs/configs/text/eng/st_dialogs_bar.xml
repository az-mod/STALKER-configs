        <text>Well, there are a couple of places here. Like the "100 Rads" bar, or the Arena. This place is just somewhere you can take a break from all the crap that's going on around the Zone. An oasis, that's what I'd call this place...</text>

    <string id="bar_universal_dialog_9">
        <text>I think so, you can go to Kalgan's arena and sign up for a fight if you're confident. Or you can just watch stalkers beat up each other. Sometimes those matches get so brutal, they give you nightmares for weeks...</text>
